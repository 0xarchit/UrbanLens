## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it via email instead of creating a public issue.

2.  **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours.
3.  **Process**: We will investigate the issue and keep you updated. Please allow us reasonable time to patch the issue before public disclosure.

Thank you for helping keep UrbanLens secure.
